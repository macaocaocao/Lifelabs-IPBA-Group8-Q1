    <img src="Part2-2 Profit Projection.JPG" width="600" height="300">
        <p style="color: #6b4a1f;">The photos you see up top ↑ is the 1 Part of the Profit projection, you can see that there are 2 minor parts inside. The first part shows how to find the Projected Profit and the Total sales of the tickets. The second minor part shows the computation/solution on how we divided the Projected Profit to the Producer and the 5 Organizers.</p>
    <img src="Part 2.JPG" width="300" height="300">
        <p style="color: #6b4a1f;">This is the 2nd Part of the Profit Projection ↑. You can see what price we agreed<br>
             upon as a group for the ticket price, and what the equal amount of shares we<br>
              divided for the Organizers and the Producer.</p>
    <img src="part 3.JPG" width="300" height="300">
        <p style="color: #6b4a1f;">This is the final part ↑, the Part 3. Part 3 is all about us justifying<br>
             our price ticket and why it was set at that price.</p>
